# Smart-Blind-Stick1
The smart blind stick automatically detects the obstacle in front of the person and give him a response to the person by vibrating the stick and also with a warning sound. Through this, the blind person can aware about the obstacles in front of him. I used Ultrasonic sensor for detecting the obstacles.
